# discord-gotify-notification

## CODE IS STILL NOT READY, PLZ WAIT.

Use gotify as a notification service for discord due to the official discord client notification not working on lineageOS.

### This project uses discord.js to fetch messages. You can only get messages from servers that you have your bot in.

Brain dead simple ooga booga code. Might add more features down line.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sand1234560/discord-gotify-notification/wiki) for configuration and setup guide.

## Maybe possible
- images in notification.
- Clicking on the notification links to discord instead of opening gotify.
