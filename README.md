# discord-gotify-notification

Use gotify as a notification service for discord due to the official discord client notification not working on lineageOS.

Brain dead simple ooga booga code. Might add more features down line.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sand1234560/discord-gotify-notification/wiki) for configuration and setup guide.

## Maybe possible
- images in notification.
- Clicking on the notification links to discord instead of opening gotify.
